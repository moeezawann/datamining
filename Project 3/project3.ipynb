    "#### The aim of this project is to gain practical experience in handling a regression problem by building models to predict the price of a cryptocurrency. As cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by multiple factors, predicting their prices requires a thoughtful approach to data analysis and model selection. For this project, I’ll explore different feature engineering and pre-processing techniques to optimize model performance. I’ll begin by constructing a linear regression model, examining how well it captures trends, and possibly experimenting with other regression techniques to push predictive accuracy further. Altough I could predict for the future I want to gauge just how well my model predicts. In order to do this I will be prediciting prices for 2019 and comparing with the actual this will give us better insight on the predicitive capabilities of my model!\n",

    "For those who are new to the world of cryptocurrency, let's start with a brief introduction before diving into the specifics. Cryptocurrency, often referred to simply as 'crypto,' are a digital or virtual form of currency that relies on cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments and regulated by central banks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology. Okay but what even is that? This means that a crytpo like \"Ethereum\" operates on a network of computers (nodes) spread worldwide rather than relying on a single, central authority, like a bank or corporation.  This structure allows for transparency, security, and independence from central authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to serving as digital money, cryptocurrencies have a range of applications that go beyond just buying and selling. For instance, they enable fast, low-cost global payments, provide financial services for those without access to traditional banking, and support a variety of online services through smart contracts. Smart contract you say? What makes it so smart? Smart contracts are a self-executing program or code that runs on a blockchain, automatically enforcing and executing the terms of an agreement when certain conditions are met. With crypto, we see innovations across fields like finance, supply chain management, gaming, and art through NFTs (non-fungible tokens)."
